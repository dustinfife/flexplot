\title{Align Logistic Regression Curves at the Threshold}
\usage{
logistic_aligned(flex_obj, resolution = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{flex_obj}{A \code{ggplot} object returned by \code{flexplot()} that includes
both \code{formula} and \code{data} attributes (set automatically by \code{flexplot()}).}

\item{resolution}{The number of evenly spaced x-points to generate per group for plotting
the logistic curves. Defaults to 100.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing threshold-aligned logistic regression curves,
  optionally paneled by conditioning variables.
}
\description{
This function extracts the data and formula from a \code{flexplot()} object,
fits a logistic regression with all interactions, and then plots the resulting
curves with their \eqn{p = 0.5} thresholds aligned on the x-axis. This improves
visual comparison of slopes by eliminating left/right intercept shifts.
}
\details{
The alignment is done by identifying the x-value where each curve crosses
\eqn{p = 0.5} and shifting all predicted x-values so that each curve aligns at that
point. The resulting plot displays all curves horizontally centered at the
logistic threshold.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
d = data.frame(
  y = factor(rbinom(200, 1, 0.5), labels = c("no", "yes")),
  x = runif(200, -3, 3),
  g = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 100)
)

p = flexplot(y ~ x + g, data = d, method = "logistic")
logistic_aligned(p)
}
