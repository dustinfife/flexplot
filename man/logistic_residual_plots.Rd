\title{Create residual plots for logistic regression models}
\usage{
logistic_residual_plots(data, object, n_bins = 10, plot_type = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The model data frame}

\item{object}{The fitted glm object (binomial family)}

\item{n_bins}{Number of bins for creating binned residuals}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
A list containing histogram, residual dependence plot, and scale-location plot components
}
\description{
Creates a set of residual plots specifically designed for logistic regression,
using binned residuals instead of raw residuals which are not meaningful for binary outcomes.
}
\details{
This function creates binned residuals by:
\itemize{
  \item Binning observations based on fitted probabilities
  \item Computing observed proportions within each bin
  \item Calculating residuals as observed - fitted proportions
}
}
